        "The sunlight reaching us from low in the sky has passed through even more air than the sunlight reaching us from overhead. As the sunlight has passed through all this air, the air molecules have scattered and rescattered the blue light many times in many directions. Also, the surface of Earth has reflected and scattered the light. All this scattering mixes the colors together again so we see more white and less blue. As the Sun gets lower in the sky, its light is passing through more of the atmosphere to reach you.",

        "Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time. It's easy to see that the sky is blue.

Make Four Photocopies of Your Passport & Visa(s). Here is a policy that I've followed for years and that is to make four copies of my passport identification page. I then leave one copy each with two different friends or family members that I trust and that I can reach in an emergency in case I need them to fax me or an embassy a copy of my passport.",

So much of our daily personal and professional lives are now reliant upon computers, smartphones, tablets, and even smart TVs. Privacy and security are crucial to make sure any sensitive information is adequately protected. More individuals have become aware of the cyber security industry in the last decade because of high profile attacks, including attacks that have threatened the work of the United States federal government.

        "The hotter a star, the more blue light it gives off, while cooler stars appear red. With a temperature that tops 27 million degrees Fahrenheit in its core, the sun is “somewhere in the middle, in this weird space where we can’t perceive its color,” Pesnell said — but the massive, glowing mass of gases is bound to change hues in the very, very distant future. The sun is the source of all the light and heat that makes flowers bloom, birds sing and beachgoers smile because of the conversion of hydrogen into helium taking place deep inside its core. However, that hydrogen gas will eventually run out. The sun will balloon and take on a deep red shade before it turns Earth and other nearby planets into snacks.",
        "I’m just telling a person in their 20s that the sun used to be yellow when I was a child and he’s laughing. The last time he saw a yellow sun was on Teletubbies. Here’s the sun right now. White and a weird shape. How’s it looking where you are?",
        "Japanese children might make their circle red, not unlike their country’s flag. Now, adults are fiercely debating the color of our solar system’s star, with some insisting it has changed hues since their childhood. It all started last week when writer Jacqui Deevoy tweeted that the round yellow sun of her childhood had suddenly turned white and wonky looking. In a matter of days, the post amassed over 6 million views and divided users into two camps: those who agreed with Deevoy and those who said the sun had always looked white. I’m just telling a person in their 20s that the sun used to be yellow when I was a child and he’s laughing."

        "We say we see different colors because of how our brains learn to link the signals they get from the eyes with the names of different colors. When a baby points at a ball and her father asks, “Would you like to play with that green ball?”, she learns to associate the color she’s seeing with the word “green,” and she will soon call things of a similar color “green” as well. Many other things can affect how your brain sees color, including the season, what you looked at before, or the position of your body. Try this experiment to see for yourself: Lie down on your left side for five minutes with your eyes shut. Now, close your left eye and open your right eye.",

Cells are the building blocks of all life. The cells in the back of our eyes, which help us to see color, are called cones.

        "There are also lots of wavelengths we can’t see, which create colors we can’t even imagine. Waves of different lengths make up the colors in light. Wikimedia Commons Most of the objects we can see around us don’t make light themselves. Instead, light from the sun, the moon, or man-made lamps hits them. Depending on the object, some wavelengths of light will bounce off, while others will be taken in."
