        "The sunlight reaching us from low in the sky has passed through even more air than the sunlight reaching us from overhead. As the sunlight has passed through all this air, the air molecules have scattered and rescattered the blue light many times in many directions. Also, the surface of Earth has reflected and scattered the light. All this scattering mixes the colors together again so we see more white and less blue. As the Sun gets lower in the sky, its light is passing through more of the atmosphere to reach you.",

        "Sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere and is scattered in all directions by all the gases and particles in the air. Blue light is scattered more than the other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This is why we see a blue sky most of the time. It's easy to see that the sky is blue.

Make Four Photocopies of Your Passport & Visa(s). Here is a policy that I've followed for years and that is to make four copies of my passport identification page. I then leave one copy each with two different friends or family members that I trust and that I can reach in an emergency in case I need them to fax me or an embassy a copy of my passport.",

So much of our daily personal and professional lives are now reliant upon computers, smartphones, tablets, and even smart TVs. Privacy and security are crucial to make sure any sensitive information is adequately protected. More individuals have become aware of the cyber security industry in the last decade because of high profile attacks, including attacks that have threatened the work of the United States federal government.

        "The hotter a star, the more blue light it gives off, while cooler stars appear red. With a temperature that tops 27 million degrees Fahrenheit in its core, the sun is “somewhere in the middle, in this weird space where we can’t perceive its color,” Pesnell said — but the massive, glowing mass of gases is bound to change hues in the very, very distant future. The sun is the source of all the light and heat that makes flowers bloom, birds sing and beachgoers smile because of the conversion of hydrogen into helium taking place deep inside its core. However, that hydrogen gas will eventually run out. The sun will balloon and take on a deep red shade before it turns Earth and other nearby planets into snacks.",

When a baby points at a ball and her father asks, “Would you like to play with that green ball?”, she learns to associate the color she’s seeing with the word “green,” and she will soon call things of a similar color “green” as well. Many other things can affect how your brain sees color, including the season, what you looked at before, or the position of your body.

I haven’t looked back since.  I use more apples and I cut them thinner: One of the most frustrating things that happens when you make a pie is that you put in what seems like a massive amount of fresh fruit but after it slumps, shrinks, and nestles in as it bakes, you’re left with a very flat, if not concave, pie. Parks has a fantastic tip of having you mix your filling and let it macerate for a while so that the apples soften, allowing you to put a lot more in the filling and leading to pie slices stacked to the brim with apples. My original recipe calls for 3.5 pounds of apples; I’m now using between 4.25 and 4.5 pounds.",

I feel strongly that a mix of apples, ideally ones that won’t fall apart when baking, see this awesome page if you want more guidance as to which ones to choose, is the way to get the most nuanced and dynamic apple flavor in a pie. Nobody wants a one-note pie. That said, the orchard we were in had a ton of massive mutsu apples ready, and I made my last few pies with them only.",

There are so many ways to define a perfect batch, and as many ways to achieve it, but cooking basic rice on the stovetop is arguably the most versatile method. Once you’ve learned it, you’ll be able to make delicious rice anywhere, anytime, without any special equipment. We’ll teach you how to master the technique, and how to tweak it to get each batch the way you like it. Here’s how to get started: Rinse, cook, rest and fluff.",
        "It’s easy to figure out where a batch of rice went wrong, and to adjust the next one. And if you’re working on the stovetop, you’re in control: You can adapt to the rice as you go along, adding a spoonful or two or water and cooking for longer if the grains seems dry when they’re meant to be done, or letting excess water evaporate for a few minutes with the lid off if the bottom of the pot is sodden.   The rice is squishy and clumpy. This might be from excess water in the pan (check the ratio on the grains you’re cooking), but it could also be the result of skipping two crucial steps: rinsing and resting. Rinsing gets rid of the excess starch that can be responsible for overly sticky rice, and resting is important for the starchy grains, which need time to get back together and firm up after reaching such a high temperature.",
        "(If you stir the grains as soon as they’re cooked, while they’re still very hot and wet, they can break up and get mushy. ) After 10 to 15 minutes, you can use a flexible rubber spatula to fluff the still-hot rice if you like, stirring it gently, creating some volume in the pot without squishing the rice. This is also the moment to taste, and to season with a little more salt. The rice is ready, just keep it covered until you’re ready to eat.

The rice is too wet. Some rice varieties, along with rice that’s been recently harvested, require less water to cook through. You can reduce the amount of water you use the next time, but you can improvise right now, cooking it for a few extra minutes with the lid off, so as to evaporate as much water as possible. If this happens, and it seems far too wet to eat, you can always make congee."
